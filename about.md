Currently, I work at IBM as a Software Engineer on the Watson Project to improve the relevancy of search results through machine learning.  I also adjunct for the Computer Science Department at the University of Pittsburgh.

Earlier in life, I was a grad student pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, with focuses on machine learning, natural language processing, user modeling and adaptation, and information visualization.  My dissertation, titled "Adapting the Scheduling of Illustrations and Graphs to Learners in Conceptual Physics Tutoring", modified a natural language-based computer tutor to include illustrations and graphs.  I researched:
- whether illustrations or graphs helped learning: they did!
- whether there were learners or concepts that benefitted from one representation over another: there were!
- predicting which representation would lead to greater learning, then showing that it worked: it did!

In my spare time, I enjoy:
- cooking very spicy food for myself, desserts and appetizers for others, and experimental food for anyone willing to try it
- reading, particularly [rational fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction), e.g. [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) and [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning)
- nature and gardening
